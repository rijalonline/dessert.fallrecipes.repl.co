Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can be a real downer! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. You digest these grains faster than other foods which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
