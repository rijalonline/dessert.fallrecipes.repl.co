Clove is Kananfari in Hausa Mint is Na&#39;na(also Arabic).. In KD, pretty much any market, especially the Chechenia market has Na&#39;a Na&#39;a in the leaf sections. I think that using Hibiscus as a tea rinse AFTER the Henna application may be better. http://www.stutimandal.com Ba;Ea;ma;a;ma;a;va;~ya;a ; a;na;Za;a;ma;g{ea.ca;ndÒe Za;ta; a;Ba;Sa;Ma ga;tea `; a;va; a;l+.

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
