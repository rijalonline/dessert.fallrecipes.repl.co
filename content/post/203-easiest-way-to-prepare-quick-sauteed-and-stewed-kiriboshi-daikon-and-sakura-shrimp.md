It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
