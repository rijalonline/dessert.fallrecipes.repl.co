I have made this recipe for a few years. When ever I can find corned beef on sale I buy two. My only advise to others is to make at least two of these at a time because the finished product goes away much to fast and its just as easy to make two or three at a time as it is to only make one. For the pastrami: First, clean all the fat off the brisket including the &#34;V&#34; between the two muscles, then follow the fat between the two muscles and separate them making a flat and a cap.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook homemade pastrami! using 3 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.
