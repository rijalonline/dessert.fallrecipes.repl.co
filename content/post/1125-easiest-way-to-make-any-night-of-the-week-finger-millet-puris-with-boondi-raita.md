Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them more quickly than other foods which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
