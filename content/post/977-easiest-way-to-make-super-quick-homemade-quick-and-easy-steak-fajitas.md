Served with a healthy dose of peppers and onions, these fajitas are gluten free and low carb. Add lime juice, vegetable oil, chili powder, salt, and cayenne pepper to the steak in bag. Seal bag; turn to coat steak. First lay the steak in the pan in a single layer- getting it as spread out and flat as possible will add more flavor. Cook the vegetable portion in a grill basket, and for steak fajitas I also like to grill the green onions on the grill along side the steak too (I used to order sides of these when ordering meals from Baja Fresh years ago).
