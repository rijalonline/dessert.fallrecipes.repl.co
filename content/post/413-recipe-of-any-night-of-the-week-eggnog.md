It&#39;s rich, creamy, and, well, egg-y. We fall into the camp of people who love it (like really really love it). But, I recall that the recipe called for whipping the heavy cream and folding it in the chilled eggnog. I think I added a little vanilla when I whipped the heavy cream. The end result was a thicker mixture and it was frothy and so luscious in the punch bowl.
