Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
