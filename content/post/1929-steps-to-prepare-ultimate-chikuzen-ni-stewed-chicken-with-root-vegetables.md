Chikuzenni (筑前煮) or Nishime (煮しめ) is a classic Japanese dish often served on New Year&#39;s Day. This dish is made of root vegetables and chicken that are simmered in dashi, soy sauce, and mirin. My mom used to make it quite regularly because it was my family&#39;s favorite type of simmered dishes. Heat the sesame oil in the donabe and sauté the lotus root, burdock root, carrot, konnyaku, and rehydrated dry shiitake mushrooms over medium-heat. Add the sake, reserved soaking water for shiitake mushrooms, and enough dashi stock to barely cover the ingredients.
