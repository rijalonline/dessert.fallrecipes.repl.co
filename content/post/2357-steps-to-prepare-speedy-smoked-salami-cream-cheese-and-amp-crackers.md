It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
