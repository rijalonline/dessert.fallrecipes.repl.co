Fattier fish like tuna, salmon, or sea bass would be better. Speckled trout is a very tender fish and I have never tried smoking it before, never makes it past the hot grease in my house. I am willing to bet you can pretty much do the same thing as the redfish but scale it, fillet it and place it on aluminum foil. If basting you probably don&#39;t need to brine.
