Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling famished can be terrible!

These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.
