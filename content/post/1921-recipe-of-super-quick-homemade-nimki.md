recipeingredient:
- "1 cup Maida"
- "1/2 cup Atta"
- "as per taste Salt"
- "1 tsp Baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp Nigella seeds"
- "as required Refined Oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the Maida, Atta, salt, baking powder and nigella seeds and mix well.  Add the 2 tbsp oil to the mix and rub the flour and oil with your fingers so that the mix looks crumbly."
- "Add the water slowly and knead into a tight, smooth dough, cover and keep aside for 1/2 an hour.  Now add the ingredients under layering, the Maida and the ghee in a small bowl and mix well."
- "Heat oil in a wok for deep frying.  Divide the dough into 15 equal-sized balls. I made small ones, if you want bigger nimkis divide into 10 balls.. Roll out each ball into a thin circle, prick with a fork to avoid the nimki to fluff up, spread a little Maida ghee mix on the circle, fold it into a triangle."
- "Make nimkis with the rest of the dough and fry 4-5 at a time in medium-low heat for 8-10 minutes until they are light golden brown. Remember not to fry on high heat as they will brown on the outer side but will be uncooked from inside and will be chewy and not crispy.  Drain with a slotted spoon once done and once cool store in an airtight container. These nimkis keep fresh for 15-20 days easily."
