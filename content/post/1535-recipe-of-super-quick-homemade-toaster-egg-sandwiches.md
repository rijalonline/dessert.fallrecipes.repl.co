Hello everybody, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to make a special dish, toaster egg sandwiches. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Break each egg into skillet; reduce heat to low. Cook until white is completely set and yolk begins to thicken but is not hard. Place one slice of bread in the toaster (oiled side down) and press the bread down into the triangular recesses with the back of a spoon (taking care not to puncture the bread or your egg will leak out). With a metal spoon, carefully spoon the whole yolk of each egg into each of the two recesses.
