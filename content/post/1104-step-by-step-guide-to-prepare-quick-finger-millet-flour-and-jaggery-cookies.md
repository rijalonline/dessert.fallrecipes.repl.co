It's easy to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
