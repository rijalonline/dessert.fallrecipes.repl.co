If you&#39;re a vegetarian and are thinking about doing keto, you are probably finding that you are pressing your luck finding foods that will fit your diet. Vegans by nature eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables, coupled with beans, lentils, and legumes. Tofu can technically be eaten on a ketogenic diet because it&#39;s a low-carb food that provides an adequate amount of protein, especially to those opting to approach the keto diet as a vegetarian or vegan.
