The drink was also slightly tangy, which added an appropriate zing to each sip. &#34;Refreshing&#34; was the word my wife used for it, and I&#39;d agree completely.

1. Prepare 4 tbsp fizzy lemonade
1. Get  ice
1. Get 1/4 of a lemon

Why was my jar of tomato sauce under pressure and the sauce bubbly? I had a half-full jar of tomato sauce that was closed and refrigerated. When opening the jar in order to use the sauce, the air pressure inside the jar was higher than the air pressure in the room and air escaped with a woosh, similar to opening a bottle of carbonated liquid (like seltzer.) Yes, this is right - orange and other fruit juices turn &#34;fizzy&#34; after being open for a few days because microbes multiply in the sugar-rich liquid and produce dissolved gases and other chemicals which alter the flavour. This process is slowed by cold temperatures, hence the guidance to keep the juice in the fridge once it is opened.
