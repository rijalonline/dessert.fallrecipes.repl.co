- "50 grams White flour"
- "30 grams Hot chocolate mix"
- "1 tsp Baking powder"
- "1 Egg"
- "100 grams Milk"
- "30 grams Sugar"
- "30 grams Chocolate"
recipeinstructions:
- "Break up your favorite chocolate or chop it roughly. I used 6 small pieces of chocolate as shown in the top photo and cut each piece into quarters with a knife. Preheat the oven to 360°F/180°C."
- "Combine all the ☆ ingredients except for the okara in a bowl, then mix in the okara while breaking up clumps."
- "Combine the egg and sugar in another bowl. Add the milk and mix in well."
- "Add the egg mixture to the okara mixture, and mix together using a rubber spatula."
- "Pour the batter into silicone baking cups, and bake in a 340°F/170°C oven for 15-20 minutes. (Test by poking with a bamboo skewer and adjust the baking time.)"
- "When the cakes are done and cooled, put in a storage bag or cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator. If you leave them overnight, the cake will become moist, and the chocolate bits will harden and become like delicious crunchy nuts."
- "I&#39;ve been making this again recently. I cut a milk carton in half and used it as a baking mold. I baked it for 5 minutes longer than in the silicone cups."
