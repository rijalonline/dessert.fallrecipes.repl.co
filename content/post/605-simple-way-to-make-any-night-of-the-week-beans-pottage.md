Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
