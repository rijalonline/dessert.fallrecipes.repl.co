To spatchcock the chicken, flip it over so the backbone is facing you. Using a sturdy pair of kitchen scissors or poultry scissors, cut down either side of the backbone, then discard. Turn the chicken over and push down firmly on the breastbone to flatten out the bird. Make a few slashes in each leg joint.

There are many variations of piri piri chicken, but we&#39;ve based this one on the dishes found in Canada&#39;s many Little Portugals. To ensure the chicken cooks evenly, we&#39;ve used a technique called spatchcocking (also referred to as butterflying). A Portuguese dish with its roots in Angola and Mozambique, popularised in the UK by a Johannesburg-based restaurant chain, piri piri chicken may have a complicated past, but its present is crystal. This means we got to try much more of the local food, which, perhaps predictably, means we fell in love with piri piri chicken, a celebration of the pepper (also known as an African bird&#39;s eye chili), grown all over southern Africa and Portugal, after which it is named, but blended into a punchy marinade that keeps the heat at bay.

Place the spatch-cocked chicken on a baking tray and pour over one third of the sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining Â½ tsp salt and the black pepper. Traditional Portuguese Chicken, also called Peri Peri Chicken (or sometimes Piri Piri Chicken) is made with Piri Piri peppers which actually originated in South Africa, and were imported to Portugal from two Portuguese colonies, Angola and Mozambique, on spice ships.
