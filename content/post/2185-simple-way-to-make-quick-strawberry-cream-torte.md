Hello everybody, it is Louise, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, strawberry cream torte. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Strawberry Cream Torte is one of the most favored of current trending foods on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They are fine and they look wonderful. Strawberry Cream Torte is something which I have loved my entire life.

The first strawberries have started appearing in the markets, juicy and glossy, fragrant with the promise of summer and sun. Of course, as soon as I see strawberries I get a craving for that most summery of recipes: an Erdbeer Sahnetorte - a German Strawberry Cream Torte. Place cream cheese and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat on high speed until fluffy and well blended. While the motor is still running, add small amounts of the whipping cream in a steady small stream into the cheese mixture, NOT TOO FAST, or the mixture will be too runny.


To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have strawberry cream torte using 21 ingredients and 15 steps. Here is how you cook it.

Rich pound cake cut into three layers, filled with fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and strawberry purée. Topped with whipped cream and strawberries. I also made a strawberry mousse to put on top, so the fresh cut strawberries make a middle layer! I was so delighted with myself I made a chocolate/banana version in a chocolate crust, but with out the cream cheese layer! Specialty tortes must be ordered at least one week in advance.
