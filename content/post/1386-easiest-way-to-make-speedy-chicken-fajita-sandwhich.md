Philly cheesesteak sandwiches are a classic favorite, and this is a twist on the original version with Mexican spiced chicken instead of steak. Trim chicken of any excess fat and place in a large, lidded bowl. Toss, adding more oil if necessary, until coated. Poke chicken with a knife to allow penetration of seasoning and oil.

Toss, adding more oil if necessary, until coated. Poke chicken with a knife to allow penetration of seasoning and oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper, then add to bowl and toss to coat. This is my recipe and want to point out that these are not &#34;fajitas,&#34; they are melts; open-faced sandwiches that are topped with cheese and broiled (ie tuna melts, patty melts). We still have fajitas sometimes, this is just a different quick meal, cooks relatively quickly and goes down quick.
