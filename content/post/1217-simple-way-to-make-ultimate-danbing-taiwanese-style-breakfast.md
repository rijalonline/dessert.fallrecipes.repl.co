Just thought I&#39;d make this fun little video since most of us are self isolating at home. I got really bored one day so I decided to shoot a video on how to make Taiwanese style. Dan bing, a type of Taiwanese style savory pancake, was one of the breakfast/brunch foods they would make because it was simple and filling (the proteins in the egg and pork floss and the carbs in the tortilla would provide them with energy to study—or play—for the rest of the day). While at the American diner, you would expect to find eggs, toast, bacon, hash brown, sausage, and pancakes, when you go to a classic Taiwanese breakfast vendor, you&#39;d find a mix and match combination of shaobing, scallion omelette, youtiao (Chinese fried dough/stick), danbing, soymilk, etc.

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer too, helping you feel better. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
