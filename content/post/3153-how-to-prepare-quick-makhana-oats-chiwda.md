It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods also. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
