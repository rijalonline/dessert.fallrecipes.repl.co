recipeingredient:
- "150 grams Konnyaku"
- "3 tbsp Hijiki seaweed dried"
- "1 tbsp Sesame oil"
- "1 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 Green onion parsley or other garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Parboil the konnyaku, rub it a little with salt and rinse. You can skip this step if you use konnyaku that doesn&#39;t need parboiling."
- "Rinse the hijiki seaweed lightly, soak for about 5 minutes and squeeze out tightly. Don&#39;t discard the soaking water."
- "Slice the konnyaku into thin rectangular slices. If the hijiki is long, cut it to the same length as the konnayku."
- "Stir fry the konnyaku in a dry pan (no oil added). When the moisture on the surface is gone, push the konnyaku to the side of the pan, add the sesame oil to the empty space on the bottom, add the hijiki seaweed and stir fry to 2 to 3 minutes."
- "Stir fry the konnyaku and hijiki seaweed together quickly. Add enough of the hijiki seaweed soaking water to cover the ingredients halfway (use regular water if there isn&#39;t enough soaking water)."
- "Bring to a boil and cover with a lid. Simmer over low heat until the hijiki seaweed is tender. If the pan gets dry before the hijiki is tender, add a little water."
- "When the hijiki is tender enough to mash with your fingers, flavor with soy sauce and simmer for another 2 to 3 minutes."
- "Stop simmering when there&#39;s still some liquid left in the pan. Garnish and serve."
- "If you make a lot, chop some up the next day and stir-fry it with tofu to make a delicious scrambled tofu dish. You can even use it as a gyoza dumpling filling!"
