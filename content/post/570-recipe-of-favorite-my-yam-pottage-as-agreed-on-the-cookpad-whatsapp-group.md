It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel terrible! These grains can improve your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
