Nihari is a traditional dish of Muslims of Delhi, Bhopal and Lucknow. In Karachi, Nihari became a roaring success and soon all over Pakistan. Now Nihari is available in Pakistani restaurants around. Nihari is a beef stew popular in the northern region of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

The flavour is decidedly different, earthier, more robust. Most commonly, nihari is made with beef shank or shoulder, but lamb, mutton, and goat meat are also popular. Cuts of red meat that include cut bone will create a more flavorful stock due to the presence of bone marrow. Add meat and fry it a little.
