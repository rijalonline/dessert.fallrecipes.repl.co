Grains can be excellent for overcoming a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all great for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
