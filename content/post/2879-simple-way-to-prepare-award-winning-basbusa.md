It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling famished can actually bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
