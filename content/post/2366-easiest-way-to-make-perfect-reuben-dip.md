Russian dressing is a little bit spicier, and thousand island is a little bit sweeter. This dip has all the elements you love in both a Reuben sandwich and a party snack: hot and creamy cheese, a mix of salty and sweet flavors from the corned beef and the Thousand Island dressing, and a crispy topping of toasted rye bread crumbs.
