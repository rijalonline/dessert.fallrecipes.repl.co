It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
