It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
