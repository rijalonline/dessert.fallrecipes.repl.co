Chicken thighs, considered a dark meat, are not only less expensive than white breast meat, they also have more flavor, albeit more fat. Because of the extra fat, chicken thighs do not dry out as quickly as white meat does, lending itself well to high-heat cooking methods such as frying. Since you&#39;re heating the oil much higher than it gets in a pan or the oven, it&#39;s super important to choose the right type of cooking fat. This fried chicken recipe is AWESOME.
