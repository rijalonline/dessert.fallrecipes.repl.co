It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
