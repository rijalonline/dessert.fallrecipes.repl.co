Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly excellent for helping increase your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you are starving!

They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
