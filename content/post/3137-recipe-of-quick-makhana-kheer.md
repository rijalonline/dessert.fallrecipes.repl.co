Grains can be good for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling famished can actually make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
