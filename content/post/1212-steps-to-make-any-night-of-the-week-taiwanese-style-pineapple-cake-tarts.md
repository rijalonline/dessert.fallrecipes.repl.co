This is my all time favourite Sarawak honey pineapple paste, though costlier than all. The Taiwanese pineapple cake is different from the Singapore/Malaysia pineapple tart that I used to make. First, the filling contains mashed winter melon instead of pure pineapple. Secondly, it is shaped into a square with a mold, whereas the Singapore/Malaysia version is mostly open-faced. Visitors to Taiwan will likely have enjoyed pineapple cakes 鳳梨酥, which are widely sold and enjoyed throughout the year.
