Hey everyone, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, nihari. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Nihari comes from the Arabic nahaar (نهار ‎), meaning &#34;morning&#34;. It was originally eaten by Nawabs in the Mughal Empire as a breakfast item after their Islamic morning prayer of Fajr. There are several masala brands that sell a Nihari spice mix and while I enjoy it immensely there is something eminently satisfying about homemade. The flavour is decidedly different, earthier, more robust.
