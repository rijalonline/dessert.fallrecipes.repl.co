Hello everybody, it is Jim, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, deep fry salmon with mixed veggies. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Not only does the combination of salmon and crisp batter produce a delicious dish but cutting through the crispy batter also reveals pretty pink flakes of the salmon. Arrange the filets of salmon onto a baking sheet. Season the salmon with sea salt or Kosher salt, and freshly cracked black peppercorns on both sides of the salmon pieces. Set the salmon in the fridge until you are ready to cook them in the deep-fryer.

Deep fry salmon with mixed veggies is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It's easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. They're fine and they look fantastic. Deep fry salmon with mixed veggies is something that I've loved my entire life.

##### The ingredients needed to make Deep fry salmon with mixed veggies:

Mix the dry ingredients together in a bowl, add liquids, and carefully stir together. Dip veggies into batter and drop into hot oil, cooking until golden brown.
