Okara is the soybean pulp left over from the process of making tofu. The most general recipe is boiling okara with in carrot, shiitake mushrooms and abura-age (deep-fried tofu) in a sweetened soup stock. Because I make my own tofu I always end up with a glut of the leftover soy pulp, or okara - that&#39;s the ground up soy beans left once you strain the milk out. I&#39;m ashamed to say it often ends up getting binned (it has a very short shelf life), but I do try to use it in as many creative ways as possible..
