Some grains are truly wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping increase your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be a real downer! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
