recipeinstructions:
- "Prep work"
- "Warm unsalted butter to room temperature, or warm it by immersing in lukewarm water until it becomes soft. Also bring the eggs to room temperature."
- "Beat the ★ eggs and whisk with the brandy. Sift all of the dry ingredients marked ☆ together."
- "Line the mold with parchment paper and preheat your oven to 170℃."

- "Whip the butter until it expands and becomes a rich cream. If you cream the butter well, it will be hard for the butter and eggs to separate when you add the eggs."
- "Add sugar to the batter from Step 6 in 3 or 4 batches and mix until thick. Make sure to mix it very well!"
- "Add the ★ brandy and egg mixture from Step 3 to the butter and sugar mixture in 5 or 6 small batches, mixing well to ensure it doesn&#39;t separate."
- "Take the dry ingredients from Step 3 (marked ☆) along with almond flour and add to the mixture from Step 8 in 3 or more increments. The almond flour makes the cake moist."
- "Pour the cake batter in Step 9 into the cake mould, and tap the bottom of the pan to make sure that the batter gets into all the corners. If you have batter left over, try adding your own flavours For example, dried fruits."
- "Bake the Step 10 cake for 45 to 50 minutes. If you see the cake browning and it&#39;s looking like it might start to burn, cover with aluminum foil."
- "15 minutes before the cake is finished baking, turn the pan in the oven to prevent unevenness. Check to see if the cake is done by inserting a skewer. If it comes out clean, it&#39;s done!"
- "Finally, we&#39;re going to brush the cake with brandy, so make especially sure that the cake is totally done."
- "While the cake is still hot from the oven, brush half of the brandy on the cake. After the cake has cooled, brush the rest."
- "Wrap the cake in plastic wrap, and place it in a plastic bag. Let the cake rest in the fridge for 7 days. In my case, I let it rest for 12 or 13 days."
- "Top the cake to your liking with any remaining brandy. While the cake was resting in the fridge, the brandy and butter mingled to infuse the cake with moisture."
- "If you wrap it, the cake can be a gift or present!"
- "I cut up broiled sweet chestnuts from a pastry shop and scattered on top The sweetness of the chestnuts comes out with each bite and it was very delicious!"

But Mama&#39;s a Southern Baptist, so drinkin&#39;s a sin. Fruit cake is a traditional British Christmas cake that is full of fruits and nuts and laced with alcohol, usually brandy. This gives the fruit cake a subtle brandy flavor and a moist texture, plus it also allows the fruit cake to be stored for a long time. I always enjoy eating it with a glass of red wine or even a cup of espresso. Brandy, rum or sherry are the suggested alcohols to use for soaking your fruit and topping the cake.
