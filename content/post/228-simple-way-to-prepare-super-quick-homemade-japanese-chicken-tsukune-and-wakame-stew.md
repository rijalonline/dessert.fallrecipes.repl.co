Traditionally made into small meatballs, sometimes boiled first, I baked mine before skewering and finished the skewers off on a flat grill. Basted with a seasoned Teriyaki Sauce. When the meat is cooked, pour the teriyaki sauce and cook until the sauce is almost gone, turning them over once or twice.
