##### The ingredients needed to make Clover Bread:

1. Make ready 1.5 Cups All purpose flour
1. Prepare 1/2 Cup water Warm
1. Make ready 1/2 Teaspoon Yeast
1. Prepare 1 Teaspoon Salt
1. Prepare 1 Tablespoon Sugar
1. Take 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
1. Take 2 Tablespoons Butter salted ,
1. Take 1 Tablespoon Garlic ,  minced
1. Get 2 Tablespoons basil ,  chopped


You can use either fresh or dried clover flowers: either will add a lovely texture and a hint of color to the bread. Shape each piece into ball; roll in herb mixture. Really high protein flours (often called bread flours) absorb a lot of water, and lower protein flours (cake flour is probably the lowest) absorb less. Each brand will use a different blend, and the one I used absorbs less on the whole, but is known, especially in the Southern US, for its excellence especially for making tender flaky biscuits.
