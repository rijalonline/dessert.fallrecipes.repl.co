- "15 grams Cake flour or tempura flour"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Water"
- "1 Deep frying oil that youve used several times"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, add the flour and water, and mix until there are no lumps. Easy!"
- "Heat the oil to 170-180°C. Leave some batter on the whisk and gently tap the edges of the pan. The batter will form into small tempura bits without creating big lumps. Once they are nice and crisp, just drain off the excess oil and they&#39;re done."
- "Since this recipe uses recycled deep frying oil that has been used several times, they are good enough as-is even if you don&#39;t use tempura flour. The batter bits absorbs the great flavor from your previous fried dishes. The recipe doesn&#39;t call for eggs, so you don&#39;t need to worry about your cholesterol intake. But of course, you can use tempura flour (with water and egg) instead."
