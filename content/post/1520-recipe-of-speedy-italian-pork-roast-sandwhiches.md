This is a truly legendary sandwich. A Philly-style Italian pork sandwich is a thing of beauty, heaped with pulled pork, smothered in drippy broccoli rabe (or spinach, depending on who you&#39;re talkin&#39; to), topped with peppers, laden with a base of gooey provolone cheese, and served on a perfectly crisp yet soft Italian roll. The traditional roast pork sandwich is made with provolone cheese; Manchego has slightly stronger flavor, which is a great complement to the pork and greens. If you can&#39;t find Manchego, use provolone.
