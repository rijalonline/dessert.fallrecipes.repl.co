- "Allow the milk mixture to boil for 1 min.  Remove from heat.  While still whisking, gradually ladle the milk mixture into the yolk mixture.  This is to temper the egg."

- "Transfer into a bowl and cover with cling film.  Make sure the cling film is in contact with the custard.  Set aside to cool down."

- "Melt dark and milk chocolate on a double boiler.  Once melted, remove from heat and stir in a pinch of salt and Nature&#39;s Superfoods&#39; raw cacao nibs.  Pass the cream mixture thru a fine sieve and into the chocolate mixture, 1/3 portion at a time."
- "Gently fold to combine well.  Discard all the residue.  Repeat the process until all the cream mixture is fully incorporated."
- "Brush a thin layer of the chocolate mixture onto the frozen crust.  Return back into the freezer for 5 mins.  *This is to ensure there isn&#39;t any leakage.*  After 5 mins, pour the chocolate mixture into the cake pan."

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
