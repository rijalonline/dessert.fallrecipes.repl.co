It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually wonderful for helping raise your happiness levels. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
