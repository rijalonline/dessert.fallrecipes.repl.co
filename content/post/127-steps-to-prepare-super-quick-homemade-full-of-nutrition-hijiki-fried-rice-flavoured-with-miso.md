Some grains are really excellent for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
