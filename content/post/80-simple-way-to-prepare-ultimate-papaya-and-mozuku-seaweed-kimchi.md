Grains can be excellent for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! These grains can improve your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them.
