Grains can be great for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
