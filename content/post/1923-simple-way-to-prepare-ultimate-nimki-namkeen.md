It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
