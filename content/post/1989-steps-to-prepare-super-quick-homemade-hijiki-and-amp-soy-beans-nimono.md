There is a health concern about the level of inorganic arsenic in Hijiki and some say it is toxic. Scientifically known as Sargassum fusiforme, hijiki is a type of seaweed that is typically brown or dull green when cultivated or collected in the wild. It grows on the coastlines on Japan, China, and Korea, and has become a staple variety of seaweed in many cultural dishes. There are two types of hijiki, which are actually just different parts of the same species: &#34;stems&#34; (nagahijiki) and &#34;leaves&#34; (mehijiki). Some people find the smaller, flat, bud-like mehijiki, with its almost velvet texture and mild flavor, easier to cook with than its tougher counterpart—and, conveniently, mehijiki is also the type more readily available in Asian supermarkets here in.
