It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. It's not difficult to feel depressed when you are starving! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process.
