It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
