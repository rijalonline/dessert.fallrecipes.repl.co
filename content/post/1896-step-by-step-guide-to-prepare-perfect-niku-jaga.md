Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood sugar which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
