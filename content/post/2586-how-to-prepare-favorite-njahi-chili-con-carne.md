It's not hard to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. It's easy to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
