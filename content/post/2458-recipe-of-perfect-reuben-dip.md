Make sure to serve this in a hot chafing dish or keep the baking dish on an electric hot tray.

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really wonderful for helping boost your happiness levels. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
