Some grains are truly excellent for fighting off bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full also which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
