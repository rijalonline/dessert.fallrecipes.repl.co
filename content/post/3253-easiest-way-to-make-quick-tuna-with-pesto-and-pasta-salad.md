It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you feel happier. These grains fill you up better and that can help improve your moods too. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
