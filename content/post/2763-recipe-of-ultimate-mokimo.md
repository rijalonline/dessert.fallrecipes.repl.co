It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood because it's easy for your body to digest them. You digest these grains more quickly than other things which can help boost your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
