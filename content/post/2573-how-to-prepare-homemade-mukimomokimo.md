Grains can be good for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods also. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your glucose levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
