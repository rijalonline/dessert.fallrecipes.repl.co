Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods also. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
