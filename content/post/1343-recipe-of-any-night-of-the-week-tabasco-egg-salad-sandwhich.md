Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full also which can truly help to improve your mood. It's not hard to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
