It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling starved can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest and process. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
