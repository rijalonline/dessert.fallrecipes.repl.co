It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
