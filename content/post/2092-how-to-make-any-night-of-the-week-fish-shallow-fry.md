As the name suggests, deep-fried fish is going to require a pan with a deeper interior. Do not move until it releases naturally - Most fish fillets will initially stick to the pan as they start to cook (unless you&#39;re using so much oil you&#39;re basically shallow frying them). But it naturally releases once the surface is cooked and golden. So give it a nudge, and if it doesn&#39;t want to move, then it means that it&#39;s not ready.

Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
