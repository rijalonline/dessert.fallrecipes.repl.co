Thin the dressing with up to a tablespoon of water, as needed. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss. Thinly slice the steak across the grain and serve it over the salad. In my version of a warm steak salad, rather than cook the cut of meat whole and then slice it, I do it a little differently. I cube a sirloin steak, season it well, then saute it in olive oil.
