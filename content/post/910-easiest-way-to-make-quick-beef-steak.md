Filet mignon is the name of the steak cut from the beef tenderloin, a long, cylindrical muscle that runs along the spine. It&#39;s one of the most expensive cuts of beef because the muscle doesn&#39;t get much work, and it&#39;s so tender you could cut through it with a fork. Steaks are like wine - the more you spend, the better they are. Juicier, more flavour, more tender, no random bits of sinew throughout.
