Add garlic, potatoes, tomato sauce and enough water to cover the potatoes. Season with oregano, salt and pepper. I pan-fried the potato cubes, luncheon meat (coated with a beaten egg) and onions individually to slight golden brown and set aside. Next, I prepared the tomato sauce in the wok and using sugar to taste as I did not want the dish to be too sourish. Brown patties on both sides; drain.
