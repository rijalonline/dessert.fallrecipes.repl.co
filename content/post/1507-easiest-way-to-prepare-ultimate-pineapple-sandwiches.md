1. Get 2 slice pineapple
1. Take 3 bread slice
1. Take 2 tbsp pineapple jam
1. Make ready 2-3 mint

Rings are the way to go for a pineapple sandwich. Crushed and chunked pineapple is too juicy, even when drained, and no amount of mayo will hold those little pieces in place on the bread. If you&#39;ve not enjoyed a pineapple sandwich in a while, it&#39;s time for another. Add the sugar and the pecans to this mixture.
