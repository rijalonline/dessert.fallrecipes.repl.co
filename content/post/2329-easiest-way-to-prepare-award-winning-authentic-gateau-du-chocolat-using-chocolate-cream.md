recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare 3 bowls and put A, B and C in separate bowls. Microwave the butter on a heatproof plate for 1 minute."

- "Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C for 28-30 minutes. When the surface puffs up and cracks, and the batter between the cracks is dry, the cake is done."
- "Leave to cool in the tin. When it is cool, take it out of the tin and peel off the parchment paper. Sift icing sugar on top using a tea strainer and it&#39;s done."
