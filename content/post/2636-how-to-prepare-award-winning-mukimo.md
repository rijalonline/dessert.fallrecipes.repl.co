Some grains are really great for repelling bad moods. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
