- "1 Parmesan cheese"
- "1 Black pepper coarsely ground"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the &#34;A&#34; ingredients into a pot, turn on the heat, and bring to a boil. As soon as it comes to a boil, turn off the heat. Give it a stir and then let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour."
- "Coarsely mince the onion. Crush the garlic by pressing it with the side of a knife blade."
- "Put the extra virgin olive oil and the crushed garlic into an unheated fry pan and turn the heat on to low to infuse the oil with the garlic fragrance."
- "At the same time as you&#39;re making the garlic oil, turn the heat back on under the soup from Step 1. Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat down to very low and leave it on."
- "Once the garlic in Step 3 has begun to brown a little and you notice the fragrance from the pan, take out the garlic."
- "If you&#39;re using pre-made garlic oil from Recipe ID 1117234, then you can skip Steps 3 and 5 and go on to Step 7."
- "Add the onions from Step 2 to the garlic oil, and turn the heat to medium-low. Lightly salt and pepper the onions and saute them until the are translucent."
- "Add the uncooked rice to the pan with the onions."
- "When you add the rice, leave the heat setting where it is and just stir the rice to coat it with the oil. *Take care not to burn or brown the rice."
- "When the rice begins to look translucent, and all of the rice has become thoroughly heated through, add in the white wine."
- "Bring the wine to a boil and let it bubble like that for 20 to 30 seconds. Next, add in the hot soup from Step 4 until it covers the rice and onions."
- "From Step 11 until the end, avoid stirring or disturbing the contents of the pan. If you&#39;re worried about it sticking or something, just give the pan a little shake."
- "Once the liquid added in Step 11 has gone down a little, add more of the hot soup from Step 4 until it again covers the contents of the pan. *The photo here shows how it looks when the liquid has gone down."
- "Repeat Steps 14 and 16 until the rice has cooked to al dente (the grains will still be a little firm in the middle)."
- "The cooking time for this stage of the recipe from Step 11 will take 15 to 17 minutes. Each time you top off the soup in the frying pan, add about 2 ladles full and cook steadily and thoroughly."
- "After about 15 minutes have passed since you first added the soup in Step 11, check the consistency of the rice to see if it has just about reached the al dente consistency that you like."
- "If the rice still seems a little too underdone, cook just a little longer. Once it&#39;s reached the desired al dente consistency, add the butter and turn off the heat."
- "Shred in some Parmesan cheese, and give the pan a gentle stir. Add salt and pepper to taste, and it&#39;s ready."
- "Serve onto a plate and top as you like with a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper or a bit of parsley."
- "This time, I topped the risotto with some scallops grilled in butter and garlic oil seasoned with salt and pepper."
- "Please give this extraordinarily simple ristorante-style risotto a try."
- "This recipe is just a base. It&#39;s delicious as is, but there are also many things you could add--chicken, of course, but also sea food, mushrooms, and so on."
- "To add those extra things, you could, for example, grill the items between Steps 5 and 6. Then from Step 11, you could simmer them together with the rice. Enjoy trying out whatever variations that suits you!"
- "When adding Manila clams or hamaguri (common oriental) clams, please refer to Steps 4-7 of. *The amount of consommé you&#39;ll use is just one cube.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/153125-authentic-vongole-risotto"
- "One important tip: Be sure to keep the soup from Step 4 on low heat so that it is hot when you add it to the fry pan in Step 11 and the contents of the fry pan will not stop boiling."
- "You will not necessarily use up all of the soup from Step 4. The amount you end up needing will depend on how strong you have the heat turned up, and your preference in the consistency (al dente texture and soupiness) of the risotto."
- "On the other hand, if you run out of soup before the rice has cooked sufficiently, you probably used too high a heat for cooking the soup and the risotto."
