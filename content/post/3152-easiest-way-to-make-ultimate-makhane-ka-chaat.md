Some grains are truly great for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel better. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
