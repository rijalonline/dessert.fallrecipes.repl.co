Nalli Nihari This whole dish was so melt-in-the-mouth and finger-licking good that we didn&#39;t need any side dish or accompaniment to the meal. I am also sure that we may have even overeaten if we didn&#39;t run out of parathas that day. By the way, this dish tastes just as fabulous with simple steamed rice. Nalli Nahari is made with the leg pieces of lamb, they are cooked in special spices, but as I made it at home I used the homemade spices that give the exact same flavour.
