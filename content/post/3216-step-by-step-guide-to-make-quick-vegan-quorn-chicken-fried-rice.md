It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult to digest. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
