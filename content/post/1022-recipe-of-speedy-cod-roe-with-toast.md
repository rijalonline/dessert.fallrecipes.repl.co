Soft Herring Roe on Toast The creamy texture of the Herring Roe, is complimented excellently by the crunchy texture of the toast, and the spice kick of the Cayenne Pepper, great as a starter or as an indulgent supper time snack! Cod roe, often confused with caviar, is considered a delicacy in certain countries, such as Norway. Hard roe is the unfertilized eggs of the female cod, and soft roe is the sperm of a male cod. The food is less common in the United States, and that&#39;s too bad because it has a distinct and delicate flavor. Stripped of the oil, milk and bread of the famous Greek spread, cured cod&#39;s roe (it is more often made with pollock roe in Japan) becomes somewhat addictive.
