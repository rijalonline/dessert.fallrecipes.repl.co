Grains can be excellent for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods as well. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.
