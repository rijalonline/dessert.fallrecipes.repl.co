In Taiwanese cuisine you will find fish cakes and fish balls dropped into broth or a noodle soup, or fried and eaten with a sweet-and-sour sauce. Erway explains that the gummy textures are so popular among children that fish cakes are now sold in a variety of bright colors and shapes -- a Hello Kitty fish cake, for instance. Korean fried chicken is fried twice, too, but the Taiwanese version is typically tossed with salt, pepper, and basil leaves, and is dusted with five-spice powder, for a crunchy, salty combination.
