I added squids to make it a seafood version. Javanese fried rice is very easy to make and can be served in your table within a few minutes. let&#39;s cook it with our easy recipe! Some people call it Nasi Goreng Jawa aka Javanese Fried Rice because it&#39;s originally from Java (one of the biggest islands in Indonesia). Some people call it Nasi Goreng Terasi aka Terasi (Shrimp Paste) Fried Rice because it uses &#39;terasi&#39; as one of the ingredients. The original recipe was a bit too sweet for me, so I modified it a little by toning down the palm sugar and kecap manis (Indonesian soy sauce that is a bit like molasses) and then upping the shrimp paste. :) I used the clay-like dried belacan I brought.
