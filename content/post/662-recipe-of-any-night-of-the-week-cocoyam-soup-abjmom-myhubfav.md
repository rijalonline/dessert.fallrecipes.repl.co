Cocoyams can also be processed into various food products used for industrial and culinary purposes. Africans usually blend cocoyam and use it as a thickener for baking and cooking soups such as oha soup and bitter leaf soup etc. Cocoyam is a nutritious and healthy food,that is either eaten boiled, steamed or made into paste and used as soup thickeners. The two common types of cocoyams in Nigeria are &#34;Colocasia esculenta&#34; &amp; &#34;Xanthosoma sagittifolium root &#34; The thickening ability of oat paste is much more than that of cocoyam paste so use this Quaker Oats paste sparingly so that your soup will not be mushy, what we call gbudu-gbudu in Igbo language.

Cocoyam is a nutritious and healthy food,that is either eaten boiled, steamed or made into paste and used as soup thickeners. The two common types of cocoyams in Nigeria are &#34;Colocasia esculenta&#34; &amp; &#34;Xanthosoma sagittifolium root &#34; The thickening ability of oat paste is much more than that of cocoyam paste so use this Quaker Oats paste sparingly so that your soup will not be mushy, what we call gbudu-gbudu in Igbo language. This is when your Bitterleaf Soup or Ora Soup is filled with cocoyam instead of having the right balance of cocoyam and bitterleaves. When cooking Nigerian soups in which we use pastes as thickeners, we usually boil the cocoyam corms (for Bitterleaf Soup, Ora (Oha) Soup) or pieces of white puna yam (for Nsala (White) Soup), then pound them into a paste before adding to the pot of soup. But what if you live in a place where you cannot buy cocoyam corms or tubers of puna yam?
