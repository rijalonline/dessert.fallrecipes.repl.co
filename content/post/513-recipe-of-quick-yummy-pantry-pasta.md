Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, helping you feel better. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood since it's easy for your body to digest them.
