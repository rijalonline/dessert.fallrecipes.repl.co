Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
