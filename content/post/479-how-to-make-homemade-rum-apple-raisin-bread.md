Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
