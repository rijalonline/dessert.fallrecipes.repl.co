It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all great for helping you feel better. These foods fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy to digest. You digest them quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
