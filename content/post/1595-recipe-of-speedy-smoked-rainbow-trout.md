Smoked rainbow trout done in the Bradley Smoker. Dry brined with brown sugar, salt and spices and smoked with alder wood. Our goal was to get a nice smoky flavor without fully cooking them, as the canning process will take care of that. In the past, I have made the mistake of trying to can fully smoked fish, and it turned out way too dry.

Our goal was to get a nice smoky flavor without fully cooking them, as the canning process will take care of that. In the past, I have made the mistake of trying to can fully smoked fish, and it turned out way too dry. Each is butterfly-filleted by hand then small-batch smoked in the traditional Northwest style over a mix of fruit woods and hardwoods. The result is a beautifully moist subtly flavored delicacy that is fully cooked and ready to enjoy as an appetizer, ingredient or as a meal. All of the amounts, time and temperature were perfect!

Some grains are really great for driving away bad moods. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. These foods can help you feel full for longer also, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can really bring you down! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
