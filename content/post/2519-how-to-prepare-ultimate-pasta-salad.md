Some grains are actually great for fighting off bad moods. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods as well. Feeling famished can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
