Black cocoa varieties labeled &#34;cocoa noir&#34; or &#34;jet black&#34; provide the darkest color and is what we relied on to achieve the intense color of our cake. This type of black cocoa looks almost like charcoal powder and is commonly used to achieve a striking black color without having to use food dye. &#34;Huge, heavy and heavenly, this cake is almost jet black, with a wicked chocolate flavour. It hardly needs it, but the glaze is great. The cake begins as a somewhat strange batter, as the large amount of brewed coffee seems to be too much liquid for the rest of the batter.

It is not trying to make a statement, but it is beautiful all the same.-the black cocoa cake was liked, a lot, by our pastry chef. She loved the bitter notes (the chocolate flavor is buried under the bitterness IMHO), especially contrasted against the sweetness of the frosting.
