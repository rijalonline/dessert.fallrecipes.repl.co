Some grains are truly wonderful for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
