Slice up the fennel &amp; add to oil, now blend and pass through a fine cloth in the fridge.  Now, boil your rice up till it’s a fluffy texture then drain the water and add the black olives. Season to taste.  Using a hand blender make the paste as smooth as possible, spread out the paste thin and allow to dry (this is your black olive garnish)."
- "Use your imagination to create your plate. I picked down the flakes of the trout, shaped the crab &amp; naturally allowed the caviar to form.  Dress up the plate, oil and serve chilled (on ice for best result)."

Grains can be excellent for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can really make you feel terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
