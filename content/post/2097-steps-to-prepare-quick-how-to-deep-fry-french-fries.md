- "2 Potatoes"
- "1 Fresh frying oil as good quality as possible"
- "1 Good quality salt"
- "1 Paper or plastic bag"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the potato into wedges and soak in water with a bit of salt and vinegar. Drain. You can also cut them into long, thin strips or sticks, or any shape you desire."
- "Once the potatoes from Step 1 have drained, completely pat dry with a paper towel. Fill a frying pan with oil 1 cm deep (you don&#39;t need too much)."
- "Don&#39;t turn on the heat just yet! Place the potatoes in the oil while it&#39;s still cold. (It&#39;s okay if they&#39;re only half-submerged in the oil)."
- "Once the potatoes are arranged in the pan, turn on the heat. The heat should be low at first. The oil should evenly start to sizzle."
- "If you start out at medium heat, the potatoes won&#39;t cook all the way through, so patiently fry them over low-medium heat. Keep frying until you can easily press a chopstick through a slice."
- "Once the potatoes have cooked through, turn the heat to high and keep frying until their surface is light brown and crispy."
- "Drain the potatoes and put them into a bag while still hot. Put a pinch of salt in the bag and shake to coat. They&#39;re done! Serve them while they&#39;re fresh!"
- "Check out, &#34;Simple! KFC-style Fried Chicken.&#34; These are much juicier and crispier when they&#39;re homemade!"
