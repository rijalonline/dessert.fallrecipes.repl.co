Some grains are actually wonderful for fighting off bad moods. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all truly great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling starved can be awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
