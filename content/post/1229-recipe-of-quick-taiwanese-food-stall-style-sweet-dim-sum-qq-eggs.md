recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Sweet Potato"
- "90 grams Shiratamako"
- "90 grams Tapioca Flour"
- "70 grams Sugar"
- "110 grams Water"
- "1 Vegetable oil for deep frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the sweet potato, cut it into chunks, and boil them. When soft, take the potatoes out of the pan and mash them while they&#39;re still hot. (You could also perform this step in a steamer or microwave.)"
- "After mashing the potatoes, mix in the sugar, and leave the mixture to cool. When cool, mix in the shirtamako and tapioca flour, then gradually add the water. Stir the mixture until it is smooth throughout."
- "Divide the dough into small portions of around 6-10 g, squeeze the dough tightly, and shape each piece into a ball. (If you don&#39;t squeeze it first, the dough will crumble and it will be hard to form a ball shape.)"
- "Heat up the oil in a flat-bottomed pan and fry the dim-sum over low heat, stirring them regularly with a spatula. I used an 18 cm diameter frying pan for this step."
- "Once the dim-sum are golden-brown, turn the heat down further (to prevent the colour from getting darker), and use the spatula to lightly press down on the dim sum around 10 times. Do this lightly so as not to crush the dim sum and so that they don&#39;t burn. This will make the dim sum more plump."
- "Once fried, drain the dim sum on some newspaper. The outside should be crispy and the inside should be nice and springy."
- "Please eat these springy dim sum while they&#39;re hot. I personally think they taste better this way than when they&#39;re cool."
