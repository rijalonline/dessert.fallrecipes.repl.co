- "4 Chocolate bars I used 60 g bars so about 240 g in total"
- "4 Eggs"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 340°F/170°C. Grease the cake pan with butter (use a 15 cm or 18 cm springform pan)."
- "Bring the eggs to room temperature. Separate the egg yolks and egg whites. Finely chop the chocolate bars."
- "Melt the finely chopped chocolate over a double broiler until the chocolate is no longer lumpy. [Note:] See tips below for the hot water bath."
- "While the chocolate is melting, put the egg whites into a large bowl and beat until stiff peaks form."
- "[Note:] To see if stiff peaks have formed, lift the whisk up slowly and check. Avoid overbeating!!"
- "Stir the egg yolks and add to the melted chocolate, stirring quickly to combine. The chocolate will harden, so stir quickly!"
- "When well combined, add half of the beaten egg whites and fold in gently."
- "Add the remaining egg whites and mix gently, being careful not to break the bubbles in the egg whites."
- "Pour the batter into the cake pan and tap the pan several times on the counter to remove air bubbles. Bake in a 340°F/170°C oven for about 35 minutes (aim for 30-40 minutes)."
- "When a bamboo skewer comes out clean without the batter sticking, it&#39;s done. The photo shows the gateau just after it came out of the oven."
- "When it has cooled down a little, remove from the cake pan and it&#39;s done!! This photo shows the gateau 30 minutes after removing from the oven."
- "[Please Read!!] Puffing and then deflating is normal for chocolate gateau. There will also be some cracks; this is proof that you baked it perfectly, so don&#39;t worry."
- "This photo shows the gateau baking in the oven. It will puff up like this and when you take it out of the oven, it will gradually deflate."
- "Baking Time: Baking time can change based on your oven and the amounts you are baking, so adjust the baking time as needed."
- "Peek into the oven (without opening the door) from time to time, and if it looks like the surface is going to burn, cover with aluminum foil for the remainder of the time."
- "Because this cake has no flour and only has eggs and chocolate, you don&#39;t need to bake until the surface browns. Please be careful not to overbake."
- "Tips for the hot water bath. I recommend heating the water for the hot water bath to around 110°F/45°C."
- "Chopping the chocolate bars as finely as possible will help the chocolate melt. Use a knife to break it up into fine pieces."
- "[When to eat] It&#39;s good fresh-baked, but if you let it rest overnight in the refrigerator, the moistness will increase and it&#39;ll be even more delicious."
- "[Q &amp; A] Q: How long does it keep? A: The gateau will be moist and delicious the day after baking, so I recommend eating it on the second day. After that, use your own judgment."
- "[Q &amp; A] Q: It deflated!  A: That&#39;s ok! That deflating is a characteristic of chocolate gateau."
- "[Cake Pan Size] If you bake the gateau in an 18 cm round cake pan, the height of the finished cake will be lower than a 15 cm pan. The surface area will be larger, so I recommend this size for when you want to slice it and serve to a large group."
- "Here I used half the ingredients (2 chocolate bars and 2 eggs) and baked the gateau in ramekins."
