Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are great at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
