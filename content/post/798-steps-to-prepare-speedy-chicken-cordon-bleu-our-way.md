Some grains are truly excellent for repelling bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can truly bring you down! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
