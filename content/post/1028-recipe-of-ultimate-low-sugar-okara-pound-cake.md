recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Fresh okara"
- "2 Egg"
- "10 grams Olive oil"
- "30 grams Artificial sugar or sugar"
- "6 drops Vanilla oil or extract"
- "50 grams Water for adjusting or soy milk if you like see Step 10"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180째C."
- "If using raw okara, you can use as-is. If using dried, use water to rehydrate (following the package instructions)."
- "Combine the eggs, olive oil, artificial sugar, and vanilla oil (vanilla essence) in a bowl and mix well with a whisk."
- "Add the okara from Step 2 and mix with a rubber spatula. Adjust as needed with water until the batter is thick and drops from the spatula."
- "Grease the pound cake pan with oil, line with parchment paper, and pour the batter into the pan (packing into the pan). Bake in an oven preheated to 180째C for 40 minutes (adjust as needed)."
- "When a skewer stuck into the cake comes out clean, it&#39;s ready. It&#39;s soft, so remove carefully from the pan so that it doesn&#39;t crumble. (Be careful not to burn yourself.)"
- "Once the cake has cooled, wrap in plastic wrap. Let chill in the refrigerator for half a day, then enjoy. It&#39;s made with okara, so drink up with fluids to keep your stomach full for the rest of the day."
- "Note: If you remove the cake immediately after baking, it will easily crumble. So, if you&#39;re worried about it crumbling, wait until it cools before removing from the pan."
- "It can be frozen. If you place it in the refrigerator at night, it will be ready to eat in the morning. If you freeze it, it will become even more moist."
- "I switched out black tea for the water and added 0.5 g of cinnamon and 25 g of walnuts. You can add any nuts or fruits you like to create variations."
- "I switched the water with 40 g of soy milk. It is delicious and melts in your mouth. Other than soy milk, you can use other ingredients such as milk or vegetable juice."
- "Try increasing the ingredients by 50% and bake in the same mold for about 70 minutes."
- "It doesn&#39;t really expand, so if you press shapes into the dough with a cookie cutter, the image will remain. When you eat it, you&#39;ll be cutting through the design, so it&#39;s just for looks."
- "This is the dried okara I used (4 x concentrate). This time, I used 40 g and added 160 g of water to create a total of 200 g."
