Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full too which can really help to better your mood. Feeling famished can truly make you feel terrible! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
