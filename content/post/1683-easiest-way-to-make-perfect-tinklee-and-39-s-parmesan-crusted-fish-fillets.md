It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you be happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling famished can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
