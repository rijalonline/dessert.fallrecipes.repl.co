##### The ingredients needed to make Chicken Thigh Cordon Bleu:

1. Take 1 tsp black pepper

I fold the chicken over the filling and instead of deep frying the breaded chicken cordon bleu like most recipes require, I bake it to perfection and drizzle it with a delicious mustard sauce. I find this cordon bleu more satisfying than the rolled kind because the chicken is meatier and has more substance. &#39;Cordon Bleu&#39; is a French term, literally translated as &#39;blue ribbon&#39;, that originally referred to an award for culinary excellence given to women cooks!
