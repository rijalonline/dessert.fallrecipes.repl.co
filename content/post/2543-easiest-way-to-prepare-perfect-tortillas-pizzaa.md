Some grains are really excellent for driving away bad moods. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
