These grains can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
