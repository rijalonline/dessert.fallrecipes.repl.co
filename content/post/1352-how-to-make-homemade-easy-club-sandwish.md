It is like chicken club meats chicken melt, and ends up with a tasty concoction as a result. This chicken club is full of flavor, and is made on buttery bread, with deli meat to keep things quick and easy. It was too rainy last night to grill, so we made club sandwiches instead. There&#39;s nothing like hickory smoked bacon, fresh tomatoes, leafy green lettuce (as opposed to iceberg), and Boar&#39;s head turkey breast.

It was too rainy last night to grill, so we made club sandwiches instead. There&#39;s nothing like hickory smoked bacon, fresh tomatoes, leafy green lettuce (as opposed to iceberg), and Boar&#39;s head turkey breast. I also added some swiss cheese. This was so good between toasted bread with a bit of mayo. Club sandwiches are usually made from plain white sandwich bread, toasted until it gets crisp.
