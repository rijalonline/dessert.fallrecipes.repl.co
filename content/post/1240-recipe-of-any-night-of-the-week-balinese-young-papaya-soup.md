Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are excellent at helping you feel happier. They can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
