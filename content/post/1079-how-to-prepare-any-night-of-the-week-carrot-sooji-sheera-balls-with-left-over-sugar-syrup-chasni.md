recipeingredient:
- "2 tbsp ghee clarified butter"
- "3/4 cup semolina sooji"
- "2 cups sugar syrup"
- "1 cup milk powder"
- "1 tsp cardamom powder"
- "2 cups carrot grated approx 2 carrots"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the leftover sugar syrup (Chasni) to boil. (I have leftover sugar syrup from rasgulla. It has saffron and cardamom pods in it). Meanwhile, while the sugar syrup is put to boil, heat ghee in a thick bottom pan or a non-stick pan. Once the ghee is heated and melted, add semolina and keep heat on low."
- "Roast the semolina on low heat for 2-3 minutes. Then add grated carrots. Saute the mixture on medium heat. Saute the mixture on medium heat till the carrots soften. It will take around 7-8 minutes. Add milk powder and mix well."
- "The sugar syrup has started boiling. Switch off the heat. Add the hot sugar syrup to the semolina carrot mixture in batches."
- "Add all the sugar syrup and mix well. The semolina will start absorbing the sugar syrup. Keep the heat on low and cover the pan with lid and cook for 2-3 minutes. Now remove the lid, the sugar syrup is absorbed nicely. Now add cardamom powder and sugar if needed. Mix well."
- "Cover and cook for 2 more minutes on low heat. The syrup is absorbed well. The carrot sheera is ready. (At this stage, you can add dry nuts, raisins and serve the sheera warm)."
- "Or now for the twist, let the sheera come at a stage where it is easy to handle with hands. Grease your hands with ghee and take small portion of sheera and roll between your palms to make a smooth round ball. Similarly make remaining sheera balls."
- "Put the sheera balls in small cupcake liners and serve them. They can be refrigerated for a week. They are easy to carry them for a potluck or picnic and a healthy afterschool snack for kids."
