It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are excellent at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can really bring you down! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your blood glucose which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.
