Work till you get a smooth, not sticky dough; cover the bowl with wrap and let the dough leaven. It must double its size (2 hrs)."
- "You’ll need: 220 gr flour, 100 gr sugar, 2 eggs and 3 yolks, 5 gr salt, 100 gr soft butter, lemon zest, candied fruit, vanilla bean, raisins 120 gr.

Wait again two hours, until the dough gets to the upper level of the mould. Then wait 10-15 minutes, so that the upper surface gets dry, make a cross cut and put in the center a butter nut. Now it’s time to cook: pre-heat the oven at 200 °C, with a small water bowl in the lower part of the oven, bake the panettone for 10-15 minutes, then lower to 190 and cook again for 10-15 minutes. If it gets too dark, lower again the temperature to 180. The panettone must be baked for one hour. Then, cool it, but upside down (look at the pic): otherwise it won’t get airy and soft."
