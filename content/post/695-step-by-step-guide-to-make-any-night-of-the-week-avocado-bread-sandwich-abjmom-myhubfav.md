Grains can be good for driving away a bad mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel better. These foods can help you feel full for longer too, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel terrible! These grains can help your mood elevate because it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
