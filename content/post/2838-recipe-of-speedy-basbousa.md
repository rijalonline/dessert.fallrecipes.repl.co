Grains can be excellent for fighting a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all really great for helping increase your happiness levels. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you feel hungry! The reason these grains are so great for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest.
