Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can be terrible! These grains can elevate your mood because it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
