It's not difficult to fight your bad mood when you consume grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you be in a happier state of mind. These grains fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. Feeling starved can be a real downer! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
