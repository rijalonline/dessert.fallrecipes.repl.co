Grains can be wonderful for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, millet, teff and barley are all actually great for helping boost your happiness levels. They fill you up better and that can help elevate your moods too. It's not difficult to feel a little bit off when you are starving! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest and process.
