Grains can be wonderful for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are excellent at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel happier, mood wise.
