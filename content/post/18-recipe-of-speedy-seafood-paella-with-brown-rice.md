Hello everybody, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, seafood paella with brown rice. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Pour in the broth, water, peas, olives, and capers. In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Paella is a classic rice dish in Spanish cuisine that&#39;s typically made with short-grain bomba (Calasparra) rice and cooked in a large, shallow pan. It originated in Valencia and is loaded with seafood or chicken and possibly other classic Spanish specialties like chorizo and serrano ham.

Seafood Paella with Brown Rice is one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions every day. They're fine and they look wonderful. Seafood Paella with Brown Rice is something which I've loved my whole life.

This is the kind of recipe that checks all the boxes for me - it&#39;s versatile, nutritious, easy and also visually pleasing.
