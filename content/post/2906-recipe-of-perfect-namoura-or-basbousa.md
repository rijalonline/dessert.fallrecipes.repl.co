Namoura (نمورة), is a delicious Lebanese cake/dessert that is super easy to make and widely known across the Middle East. This cake is called Basbousa, Namoura, or Harissa in different areas of the Middle East. My Syrian mother-in-law always calls it Harissa (also transliterated Harisseh). Ghee: I&#39;ve tried to make basbousa with regular butter, but ghee or clarified butter really is the key to getting the perfect flavor.
