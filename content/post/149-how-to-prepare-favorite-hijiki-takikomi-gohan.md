Grains can be good for overcoming a bad mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are terrific at helping you have a happier mood. They help you feel full as well which can really help to improve your mood. Feeling starved can truly make you feel awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps promote a rise in your sugar levels which in turn takes your mood to a happier place.
