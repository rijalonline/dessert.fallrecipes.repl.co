Grains can be great for fighting a terrible mood. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer also, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can truly bring you down! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
