I love this recipe because it&#39;s made with beef mince (ground beef) i.e. no meat slicing. A super-cheap, no-frills, easy dinner of satisfying ground beef and crisp vegetables, with a rich, savoury sauce to coat it all. So quick and easy, this beef dish can be prepped and marinated several hours or overnight, then it&#39;s only a matter of quickly cooking it on the stove top to get dinner on the table. Double the marinade, soak the meat with half and reserve the rest for serving with the beef as a sauce over rice or noodles.
