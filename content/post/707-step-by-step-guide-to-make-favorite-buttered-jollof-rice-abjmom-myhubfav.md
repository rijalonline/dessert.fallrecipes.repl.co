##### Steps to make Buttered jollof rice

Cook the rice on low-medium heat. When it is too low the rice might turn out soggy and too high heat would make the rice burn easily and undercooked. Allow the rice to continue cooking until the rice is soft. If it is not dry at this point, then switch the heat to low to allow it to dry the excess water without making the rice much softer. Jollof rice ingredients are by themselves healthy.
