Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Barley, quinoa, millet, teff, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They fill you up better and that can help improve your moods as well. Feeling hungry can really make you feel awful! These grains can elevate your mood as it's not at all difficult for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps kick up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
