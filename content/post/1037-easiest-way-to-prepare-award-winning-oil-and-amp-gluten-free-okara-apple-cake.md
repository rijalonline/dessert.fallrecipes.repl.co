recipeingredient:
- "2 large Eggs"
- "2 tbsp Soft light brown sugar"
- "3 tbsp Milk"
- "3 tbsp Skimmed milk"
- "1 Apple"
- "150 grams Fresh okara"
- "5 grams Baking powder"
- "1 Rum optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Line a cake pan with parchment paper. Peel the apple, cut into 8 pieces and slice. Preheat the oven to 180 ℃."
- "Break the eggs into a bowl, and whip hard with a whisk for about 1 minute continuously. It should be a bit airy (as shown in this photo). Add the ◎ ingredients and mix well. Add the apple from Step 1, and mix with a spatula. Add the okara and baking powder, and mix well with the spatula."
- "Pour the batter into the cake pan. Be sure to fill the batter into the corners of the cake pan, and smooth out the surface using the spatula. Bake in the oven for about 40-45 minutes, and it&#39;s done. When the cake is slightly cool, remove from the pan. Dust with powdered sugar to finish. Cut the cake into thick slices."
- "It&#39;s also delicious if you add cinnamon and rum raisins to this apple cake. You should try it!"
- "Increased Okara Version: Use 200 g okara, 5 tablespoons skimmed milk, and the other ingredients are the same as the normal version. It&#39;s moderately sweet since the amount of the sugar is the same. Adjust the amount of sugar to taste. This version is a little less tasty than the normal version, and it falls apart easier."
- "It may be difficult to see in this photo, but I poured caramel sauce over the cake and let it harden. It&#39;s crunchy and I like its texture. Please refer to Step 7 to make the caramel sauce. This cake is intended for a diet, so I only used 1 tablespoon sugar. But if you double the amounts to make the sauce, it might cover the cake better. Adjust to your taste."
- "Making the caramel sauce: Put 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon water in a pot, and turn on the heat. Once it becomes dark brown, add 1 teaspoon of water, and mix. Pour the sauce over the cake, and let cool thoroughly. When the caramel hardens and becomes crunchy, it&#39;s ready. If you don&#39;t let it cool completely, the sauce will stick to the knife when you cut."
- "With raisins: I made this with the &#34;Increased Okara Version&#34; and added 40 g of raisins. It&#39;s moderately sweet."
- "The cake won&#39;t rise as much as the normal version, but I was able to make this using artificial sweetener (I used the amount equivalent to 3 tablespoons of sugar with the &#34;Increased Okara Version&#34;, and added a generous amount of raisins). Apparently, artificial sweeteners lose their sweetness a little when heated. So taking that into account, adjust the amount of artificial sweetener. I recommend using granule type, not liquid type."
- "Note: The end product will vary depending on the water content of the okara you use. If the okara looks like it contains a lot of moisture, roast the okara to evaporate the moisture, or use less milk."
- "When you pour the batter into the cake pan, I think the cake will be less likely to fall apart if you press the batter firmly into the pan using a spatula."
