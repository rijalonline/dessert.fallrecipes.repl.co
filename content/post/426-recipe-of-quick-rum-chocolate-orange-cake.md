It's not difficult to overcome your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full too which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be terrible! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these grains quicker than other things which can help increase your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
