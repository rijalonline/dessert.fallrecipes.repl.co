recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the dry ingredients first and make a little “hole” for the water. Pour in the water, mixing carefully until your dough is a smooth, wet batter. It should be sticky and not too wet though!  Cover and let it rise for ±1 hour in a warm environment.  When it has risen, mix it down again and cover for another ±30 minutes.  In the meantime, butter an enamel or metal bowl. Make sure you have a large pot that can fit the bowl with room enough for you to handle it."
- "Bring half a litre of water to the boil in the large pot and put the uncooked bread into it. (The water should not reach more than half-way up the bowl). Put the lid on and let it steam at medium heat for ± 2 and a half hours. If during that time you need to refill the water, remember to do so. Before you take the bowl out, make sure that the bread is cooked by using a knife to test the level of stickiness. It should not be wet-sticky to the touch."
