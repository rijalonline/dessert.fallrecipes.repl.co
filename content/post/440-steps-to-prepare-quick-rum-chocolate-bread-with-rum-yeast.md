I left out the rum extract but the flavor from the raisins came through very nicely. It is very tasty as chocolate cakes go. The rum in the cake itself is pretty much undetectible but in the glaze it is overpowering. Next time I would skip the glaze and just dust with powdered sugar. The rum distillers use molasses (or cane juice), their own yeast, their own lacto bacillus to contribute to the esters (for instance, the Wray and Nephew big banana flavor), and distill it in such a manner so as to capture the isobutyl propionate, like the picture Harry (I think) posted of the old rum still, or by using a modern fractioning.
