Grains can be great for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are terrific at helping you be happier. These grains can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. These foods are easier to digest than others which helps jumpstart a rise in your sugar levels which in turn kicks up your mood to a happier place.
