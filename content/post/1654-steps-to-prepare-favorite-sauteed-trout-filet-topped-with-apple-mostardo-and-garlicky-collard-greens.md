recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the hot water, raw sugar, sherry vinegar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and dried currants. Let stand for at least 10 minutes."
- "Heat a small sauce pot over medium heat. Add 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and mustard seeds. Bloom the seeds in the oil (heat slowly while stirring) until the seeds start to sizzle or pop."
