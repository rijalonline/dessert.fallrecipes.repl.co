Since the brandied fruit will only improve with age, let the flavors develop for more than one month. G ood combinations include raisins, currants, sultanas, mixed peel, glace cherries, cranberries, prunes and dates - but use what you prefer. To soak this much fruit I use a cup of liquid - either alcohol or black tea. The holiday season presents a prickly moral dilemma for my mother.
