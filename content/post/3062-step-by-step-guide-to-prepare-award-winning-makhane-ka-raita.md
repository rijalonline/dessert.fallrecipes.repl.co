It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can truly help to better your mood. Feeling famished can be awful! The reason these grains are so good for your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, elevates your mood.
