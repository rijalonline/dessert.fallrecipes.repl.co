recipeingredient:
- " Rumcooked carrots"
- "100 grams Carrot"
- "10 grams Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Rum"
- "100 grams Butter"
- "50 grams Sugar"
- "2 Egg yolks"
- "2 Egg white"
- "100 grams Cake flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the rum carrots. Measure the shredded carrots into a pan with a non-reactive surface such as glass or enamel. Add the sugar and rum and mix to combine. Heat over low heat while mixing continuously."
- "When the whole thing starts to bubble and the carrots softened, take it off the heat and leave to cool. The rum carrots are done! This lasts for about a week in the refrigerator."
- "Preliminaries:  Bring the butter to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 200°C. Line the bottom of the cake pan with kitchen parchment paper. Do this by putting the pan on a sheet of paper and drawing around it with a pencil, and cutting inside the line."
- "Preparing the cake: Put the butter in a bowl, and cream well with a wooden spatula."
- "Add the sugar, and mix in well. Add the egg yolks one by one, mixing well between additions."
- "Add the cooled down rum carrots, and mix well again."
- "Whip the egg whites until they form peaks in another bowl that has no oil or moisture on it."
- "Switch to using a rubber spatula. Add half of the whipped egg white from Step 7 to the batter from Step 6, and mix together."
- "Add the sifted cake flour to the batter and mix lightly. Don&#39;t over mix!"
- "Add the rest of the egg white and fold it in, trying not to beat it. Pour the batter into the cake pan, and hit the pan several times on the bottom to eliminate any air bubbles."
- "Bake in a preheated 200°C oven for 30 minutes (this depends on the shape and size of the cake pan and the oven, so please adjust). If a bamboo skewer stuck in the middle comes out clean, it&#39;s done."
- "During or after baking, the butter will bubble up around the perimeter of the cake. This is important! This makes the surface and the sides nice and crispy. Once the cake cools down the butter will be re-absorbed into the cake, so there&#39;s nothing to worry about."
- "Try toasting the cake and serving it with whipped cream with rum, and a sprinkle of cinnamon powder. Delicious!"
