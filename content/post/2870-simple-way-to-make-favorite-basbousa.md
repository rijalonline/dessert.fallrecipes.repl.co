It's not difficult to drive away your bad mood when you consume grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all excellent for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full as well which can truly help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down!

They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps bring up your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
