If you want, you can add other seafood to the bowl, like slices of salmon sashimi, picked cooked crabmeat, uni (sea urchin), or more. In Japan, it is common to enjoy rice just as it is while the West knows it as a side to go with something else, and this is why furikake is rather prominent in Japanese daily life.
