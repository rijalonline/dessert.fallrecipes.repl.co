It's easy to overcome your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all wonderful for helping you feel happier. These foods can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can really make you feel awful! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
