It's easy to drive away your bad mood when you are eating grains. Teff, barley, millet, quinoa, etc are all excellent for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer too, which is a mood improver. It's not hard to feel low when you feel famished! The reason these grains are so wonderful for your mood is that they are easy for your stomach to digest.
