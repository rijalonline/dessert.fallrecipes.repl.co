Make ham and beans in your instant pot for a satisfying meal. It&#39;s a great way to use leftover ham and there&#39;s no need to soak the beans!. But the meat isn&#39;t the only valuable part of the ham, the hock just begs to be made into ham and beans!. I normally just leave my IP on high pressure.
