recipeinstructions:
- "Things to take note of: 1. Your water should be at a constant boil or simmer 2. Ensure that you do not leave anything in the pot for too long, if not it will overcook and become though. Thats why most of the food i choose have lots of fat in it so that it will not get tough too fast.  3. Have a pot in your kitchen with lots of stock ready so that at any point that your soup gets too little, you can go back to the kitchen and pour the soup right in!  4. I just use normal stock cubes for the broth 5. It is important to dilute your stock a bit more because while it boils in your pot, the soup will evaporate and the flavors will start getting concentrated.  6. Make sure everyone has a personal ladle to that there wont be any saliva from anyone getting mixed in. Hygiene is important!"
