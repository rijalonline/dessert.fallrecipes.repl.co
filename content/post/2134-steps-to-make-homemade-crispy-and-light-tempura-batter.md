##### Steps to make Crispy and Light Tempura Batter:

1. Sift the cake flour and baking powder together.
1. Mix the ice cubes, water and sake together. Add the sifted flour and baking powder to this in one go, mix it around with cooking chopsticks about 10 times, and it&#39;s done!
1. With this amount of batter I can fry 6 shrimp, 200 g of kabocha squash, 6 shiitake mushrooms, 1 packet of maitake mushrooms, 150 g of bamboo shoot, and 1/2 an onion. That&#39;s a lot, so if you&#39;re just frying a small amoung you can use less than half the amount of batter!


Beat egg whites in a bowl until frothy. Fold flour and cold water into egg whites until batter is just barely mixed. Tempura batter is lighter and fluffier. You want to keep the batter as cold as possible and not over-mix the batter. An over-mixed batter will result in activating the wheat gluten and causing the batter to be more chewy and dough-like when fried. (It would be great if you&#39;re making doughnuts, but not for tempura!) In case you weren&#39;t sure what tempura batter is, it&#39;s a light crisp batter that is perfect to coat fish, chicken or any other meat or vegetable you like.
