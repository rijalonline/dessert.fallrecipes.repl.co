recipeinstructions:
- "Spread the flour out evenly in a microwave-safe container. Microwave, uncovered, for a bit less than a minute at 500w. Mix, using a cutting motion."
- "Put the butter in a heavy-bottom pan. It will foam up. When you think that the foam can&#39;t get any finer, add the flour from step 1."
- "Mix well and keep cooking until the butter and flour blend together. I recommend using a whisk. Lift the pan up occasionally to prevent any burning."
- "Add just a little cold milk, and mix well. Really mix well here."
- "When the milk is incorporated, add a bit more milk and mix. Mix well."
- "Add a bit more milk and mix. Keep stirring well."
- "Add a bit more milk and mix well."
- "You can no longer see the pattern the whisk makes in the sauce at this point. Up to this point 100 ml of milk (about a third of the total) has been added in batches."
- "Add the rest of the milk 100 ml at a time. Turn the heat up a little bit, and mix and simmer until the sauce has thickened."
- "When the sauce has thickened, simmer over low heat until it&#39;s smooth. When the sauce is smooth and shiny, it&#39;s done."
- "◎The surface dries out and forms a film in no time. If you are concerned about that, skewer a piece of butter with a fork and spread the butter over the surface of the sauce."
- "◎If this sauce is for a gratin (especially macaroni gratin), make it thinner. ◎If the sauce is for cream croquettes, make it thicker. (Use a 1:1:4 or 1:1:5 ratio of flour, butter and milk)."
- "◎Use the sauce with meat sauce and eggplant for a lasagna style dish. See Okaachan&#39;s Showa-retro style meat sauce recipe.."
