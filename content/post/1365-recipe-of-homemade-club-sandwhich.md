Grains can be excellent for driving away a terrible mood. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you be happier. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. It's not hard to feel depressed when you feel famished! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not hard for your body to digest. You digest them more quickly than other things which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel more pleasant, mood wise.
