Grains can be good for overcoming a terrible mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you be in a happier state of mind. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which is a mood improver. Feeling hungry can actually bring you down! These grains can elevate your mood since it's not at all hard for your body to digest them. They are simpler to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, raises your mood.
