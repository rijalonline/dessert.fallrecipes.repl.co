It's not hard to fight your bad mood when you eat grains. Quinoa, barley, millet, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They fill you up better and that can help you with your moods too. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel awful! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not hard for your stomach to digest.
