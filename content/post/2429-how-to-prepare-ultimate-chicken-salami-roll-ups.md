It's easy to fight your bad mood when you are eating grains. Barley, millet, quinoa, etc are great at helping you have a happier mood. They can help you feel full for longer as well, which can help your mood too. Feeling starved can be terrible! The reason these grains help your mood so much is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest these foods more quickly than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
