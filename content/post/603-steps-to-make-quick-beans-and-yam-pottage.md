Grains can be great for driving away a bad mood. Quinoa, barley, teff, millet, etc are all good for helping you feel happier. They help you feel full also which can really help to better your mood. Feeling hungry can actually make you feel terrible! The reason these grains elevate your mood is that they are not difficult for your stomach to digest. You digest them faster than other foods which can help promote your blood sugar levels, which, in turn, helps make you feel better, mood wise.
