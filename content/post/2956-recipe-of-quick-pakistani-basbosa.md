Grains can be good for driving away a terrible mood. Millet, quinoa, barley, etc are fantastic at helping you feel better. They help you feel full as well which can really help to make your mood better. Feeling hungry can be awful! The reason these grains can improve your mood is that they are not difficult for your body to digest. They are easier to digest than other foods which helps raise your blood sugar levels and that, in turn, improves your mood.
