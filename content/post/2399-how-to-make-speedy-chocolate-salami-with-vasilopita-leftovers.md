recipeingredient:
- "400 g vasilopita about"
- "200 g chocolate for melting"
- "200 ml heavy cream"
- "260 g chocolate glaze optionally either store bought or homemade"
- "80 g hazelnuts"
- "50 g sultana raisins"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the vasilopita into a spacious bowl cut into pieces (relative in size and slightly larger to the pieces that you would have cut the biscuits of the traditional chocolate salami)."
- "Place the raisins in a little tepid water to soak and get soft."
- "Beat the heavy cream into a whipped cream that is not firm. It shouldn&#39;t get foamy, it should only &#34;rise&#34; a little and set but still remain thick."
- "Empty it into the bowl with the vasilopita pieces to cover them. Let it drip between them and then mix it so all pieces are well soaked."
- "Add the raisins. Let everything rest for a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes (the fresher and fluffier the vasilopita still is, the less time it requires)."
- "Then add the chocolate that you have melted in a bain-marie and mix well once more. If you are NOT going to use a glaze around the salami, this is the time to add the hazelnuts into the mixture, coarsely chopped."
- "Of course, you can flavor it and make it more tempting by adding a drink (liqueur or brandy) exactly as in the usual chocolate salami."
- "Spread a piece of aluminum foil on your worktop and a piece of greaseproof paper on top of that. Then place the mixture on the greaseproof paper and bringing the two edges of the greaseproof paper together, shape it into a roll accoring to your tastes. The aluminum foil will make this task easier and the greaseproof paper will keep it from directly coming into contact with the sweet."
- "Place the salami into the fridge for at least half an hour."
- "If you want to make the salami even more delicious when you take it out of the fridge place it on a rack (with a plate underneath it) and pour a chocolate glaze over it, turning it around so that it is fully covered."
- "In this case, you HAVEN&#39;T added the hazelnuts into the mixture (or you have only put a small portion of them) and you use them (more finely chopped for this) for sprinkling on top of the chocolate glaze."
- "Set aside for an additional half hour for the glaze to set and serve... The vasilopita will not cease amazing you."
